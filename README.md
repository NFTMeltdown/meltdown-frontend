## Getting Started

`npm` is the primary package manager used in the development of this project, so it is recommended to use it over `yarn`. 

Once you've cloned the repository, run

`npm install`

to install all dependencies. Once your download is complete, run

`npm start`

to start up the development server on port 3000. Run

`npm run build`

to build an optimized production server.

This project is built using create-react-app, which you can read up on [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
